# IDSLogAnalyzer
Introusion Detection System Log Analyzer via security-attacks-MITRE Model
In this project, the goal is to be able to analyze alerts generated by an intrusion detection system. In cybersecurity, there is a matrix called Mitre that contains details of various attacks. Each attack is introduced with a tactic that is identified by a number, for example, T101. In this program, a pre-trained model named hf.co/dattaraj/security-attacks-MITRE is used. This model is available on the website https://huggingface.co. Although the model has an API, due to its cost, I attempted to deploy the model on a local server. The server is set up on a Linux machine at the address 176.101.48.153. This model has undergone extensive training based on a large dataset, and it is possible to query the model using the Ollama API. A log file named log.json, which contains 40 alerts in JSON format, is used to send data to the model. The JSON data is parsed and sent to the model, and the modelâ€™s JSON response is received, from which useful information is extracted and displayed. A simple UI has been designed for ease of use. In this UI, the information from the log file is displayed in the left panel. By selecting the "Analyze Selected Log" button, the model starts processing, and after approximately one to two minutes, a response is sent. The response is then displayed in the right panel.
