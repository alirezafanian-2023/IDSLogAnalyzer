# IDSLogAnalyzer
Introusion Detection System Log Analyzer via security-attacks-MITRE Model.

In this project, the goal is to analyze alerts generated by an intrusion detection system. In cybersecurity, there is a matrix called Mitre that contains details of various attacks. Each attack is introduced with a tactic identified by a number, for example, T101. In this program, a pre-trained model named hf.co/dattaraj/security-attacks-MITRE is used, which is available on the website https://huggingface.co. Although this model has an API, due to its cost I attempted to deploy the model on a local server. The server has been set up on a Linux machine at the address 176.101.48.153. Extensive training has been carried out on this model based on a large dataset, and it is possible to query the model using the Ollama API. A log file named log.json, containing 40 alerts in JSON format, is used to send data to the model. The JSON data is parsed and sent to the model, and the model’s JSON response is received; useful information is then extracted and displayed. A UI has been designed for ease of use with the model. In this UI, the log file’s information is displayed in the left panel. By selecting the “Analyze Selected Log” button, the chosen log is sent to the model, which then starts processing, and after approximately one to two minutes, a response is returned. The returned response is displayed in the right panel.
